## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please email security@zacknelson.dev with details. Include a proof of concept if possible so we can reproduce quickly. We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and will coordinate a fix before any public disclosure.

Please do not open public GitHub issues for security problems.

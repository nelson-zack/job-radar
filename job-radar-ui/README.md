This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To get the job-radar-ui frontend running locally:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
RADAR_API_URL=<your radar API URL>
RADAR_ADMIN_TOKEN=<your admin token>
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
